# django-rest-mvc-generator
Generate Django models, views, urls, serializers, and additional files.

Provide a physical PostgreSQL database implementation in the root directory, and Excel file that mimics the excel file in the root directory, and modify the configuration file to properly point to the name of your two files.

Then run generate_django_files.py.

This script will create the general Django project necessary for you, with generated code for your models, views, serializers, and URLs.
